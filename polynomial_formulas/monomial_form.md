##### Find Monomials such that:
- The monomial, when created from the built polynomial, has a non-zero coefficient.
- The degree of the monomial is the same as the degree of the polynomial.
- The can divide every possible x term with a degree of `r` and every possible y term with a degree of `s`. 
In other words, the highest exponent on any x variable in the monomial is `r-1` and the highest exponent on any y variable 
in the monomial is `s-1`.
